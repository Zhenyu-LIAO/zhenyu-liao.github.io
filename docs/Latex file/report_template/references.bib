  abstract = {Semiconductor lasers provide an excellent opportunity for communication
	using chaotic waveforms. We discuss the characteristics and the synchronization
	of two semiconductor lasers with optoelectronic feedback. The systems
	exhibit broadband chaotic intensity oscillations whose dynamical
	dimension generally increases with the time delay in the feedback
	loop. We explore the robustness of this synchronization with parameter
	mismatch in the lasers, with mismatch in the optoelectronic feedback
	delay, and with the strength of the coupling between the systems.
	Synchronization is robust to mismatches between the intrinsic parameters
	of the lasers, but it is sensitive to mismatches of the time delay
	in the transmitter and receiver feedback loops. An open-loop receiver
	configuration Is suggested, eliminating feedback delay mismatch issues.
	Communication strategies for arbitrary amplitude of modulation onto
	the chaotic signals are discussed, and the bit-error rate for one
	such scheme is evaluated as a function of noise in the optical channel.

  abstract = {Chaotic signals have been proposed as broadband information carriers
	with the potential of providing a high level of robustness and privacy
	in data transmission(1,2). Laboratory demonstrations of chaos-based
	optical communications have already shown the potential of this technology(3-5),
	but a field experiment using commercial optical networks has not
	been undertaken so far. Here we demonstrate high-speed long-distance
	communication based on chaos synchronization over a commercial fibre-optic
	channel. An optical carrier wave generated by a chaotic laser is
	used to encode a message for transmission over 120 km of optical
	fibre in the metropolitan area network of Athens, Greece. The message
	is decoded using an appropriate second laser which, by synchronizing
	with the chaotic carrier, allows for the separation of the carrier
	and the message. Transmission rates in the gigabit per second range
	are achieved, with corresponding bit-error rates below 10(-7). The
	system uses matched pairs of semiconductor lasers as chaotic emitters
	and receivers, and off-the-shelf fibre-optic telecommunication components.
	Our results show that information can be transmitted at high bit
	rates using deterministic chaos in a manner that is robust to perturbations
	and channel disturbances unavoidable under real-world conditions.

  abstract = {We report an experimental study of fast chaotic dynamics in a delay
	dynamical system. The system is an electronic device consisting of
	a length of coaxial cable terminated on one end with a diode and
	on the other with a negative resistor. When the negative resistance
	is large, the system evolves to a steady state. As the negative resistance
	is decreased, a Hopf bifurcation occurs. By varying the length of
	the transmission line we observe Hopf frequencies from 7-53 MHz.
	With the transmission line length fixed, we observe a period doubling
	route to chaos as the negative resistance is further reduced providing
	the first experimental confirmation of an existing theoretical model
	for nonlinear dynamics in transmission line oscillators [Corti ,
	IEEE Trans. Circ. Syst., I: Fundam. Theory Appl. 41, 730 (1994)].
	However, other experimental results indicate limitations to this
	model including an inability to predict the Hopf frequency or to
	produce realistic continuous wave forms. We extend the model to include
	finite bandwidth effects present in a real negative resistor. The
	resulting model is a neutral delay differential equation that provides
	better agreement with experimental results. (C) 2004 American Institute

  abstract = {Traveling wave tubes (TWTs) are vacuum electronic amplifiers (see

	in the centimeter wavelength range. Increasing demand for high data
	flow in wireless communication systems (satellite communication systems
	are a good example) raises needs for making TWT's more compact and

  abstract = {We investigate the steady-state solution and its bifurcations in time-delay
	systems with band-limited feedback. This is a first step in a rigorous
	study concerning the effects of AC-coupled components in nonlinear
	devices with time-delayed feedback. We show that the steady state
	is globally stable for small feedback gain and that local stability
	is lost, generically, through a Hopf bifurcation for larger feedback
	gain. We provide simple criteria that determine whether the Hopf
	bifurcation is supercritical or subcritical based on the knowledge
	of the first three terms in the Taylor-expansion of the nonlinearity.
	Furthermore, the presence of double-Hopf bifurcations of the steady
	state is shown, which indicates possible quasiperiodic and chaotic
	dynamics in these systems. As a result of this investigation, we
	find that AC-coupling introduces fundamental differences to systems

	in systems with time-delayed feedback, Physica D 29 (1987) 223-235]

  abstract = {Following the principle of a highly nonlinear delay oscillator, we
	demonstrate the generation of an RF chaotic frequency modulated carrier,
	which could be used in chaos based communication systems. The nonlinear
	process is provided by the transfer function of an RF interferometer,
	modulating the amplitude of an FM signal; for this purpose, the path
	difference required for the interference process, as well as a long
	delay required for complex chaotic oscillation, are designed through
	the use of optical fibers. The RF signal used to produce interferences
	is transposed in the optical domain by a direct laser modulation
	with the gigahertz chaotic FM signal. The interference is obtained
	at fiber outputs terminated by photodiodes for backconversion of
	the RF signal into the electrical domain. Experimental results reporting
	the particular dynamical behavior of the nonlinear delay RF oscillator
	are presented, and also discussed in terms of chaos communication
	applications. },
