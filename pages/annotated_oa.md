title: Open Access policies, annotated
---

In order to have a better sense of what an Open Access policy for
UW-Madison might look like, I looked at the formal policies for several
universities and provide the main components below, with quotes from
the various policies.

Maybe it would be better to say "deconstructed" rather than "annotated".


### Motivation

- U Minn:
  - "commited to ensuring...public access to the research and scholarship produced"
  - "serve faculty interests"
  - "promoting greater research and impact"
  - "simplifying authors' retention of distribution rights"
  - "aiding preservation"
- U Kansas:
  - "commited to sharing the intellectual fruits of its research and
    scholarship as widely as possible and lowering barriers to its
    access."
  - "take advantage of new technologies to increase access to its work
    by the citizens of Kansas and scholars, educators, and
    policymakers worldwide"
- U Cal:
  - "committed to disseminating its research and scholarship as widely
    as possible"
  - "dedicated to making its scholarship available to the people of
    California and the world"
  - "recognizes the benefits that accrue to themselves as individual
    scholars and to the scholarly enterprise from such wide
    dissemination, including greater recognition, more thorough
    review, consideration and critique, and a general increase in
    scientific, scholarly and critical knowledge"
  - "can more easily and collectively reserve rights that might
    otherwise be signed away, often unnecessarily, in agreements with
    publishers"


### Who's covered?

- U Minn: "Each faculty member..."
- U Kansas: "Each faculty member..."
- U Cal: "Each Faculty member..."


### What's covered?

- U Minn: "scholarly articles...authored or co-authored while the
  person is a member of the Faculty"
- U Kansas:
  - "scholarly peer-reviewed journal articles to which he or
    she made substantial intellectual contibutions"
  - "while a faculty member of KU"
- U Cal:
  - "all scholarly articles authored or co-authored while the person
    is a member of the Faculty"


### Rights granted

- U Minn:
  - "grants...a shared, limited, right to make available his or her
    scholarly articles and to reproduce, display, and distribute those
    articles for the purpose of open access"
  - "grants...a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide
    license to exercise such rights under copyright as are necessary
    to achieve the goals of open access, dissemination, and
    preservation, provided that the articles are not sold for profit,
    and to authorize others to do so"
- U Kansas:
  - "grants permission to make scholarly peer-reviewed journal
    articles...publicly available in the KU open access institutional
    repository
  - "...and to exercise the copyright in those articles"
  - "permission granted...is a nonexclusive, irrevocable, paid-up,
    worldwide license to exercise any and all rights under copyright
    relating to each of his or her scholarly articles, in any medium,
    and to authorize others to do the same, provided that the articles
    are not sold for a profit."
- U Cal: "grants..nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license to
  exercise any and all rights under copyright relating to each of his
  or her scholarly articles, in any medium, and to authorize others to
  do the same, for the purpose of making their articles widely and
  freely available in an open access repository."


### Who holds copyright?

- U Minn: "The author retains copyright ownership, unless that author
  chooses to transfer rights to other parties"
- U Kansas: "The license in no way irrevocably interferes with the
  rights of the KU faculty author as the copyright holder of the
  work."
- U Cal: "This policy does not transfer copyright ownership, which
  remains with Faculty authors"


### Exceptions

- U Minn:
  - "except for any articles completed before the adoption of this
    policy"
  - "except for...any articles for which the author entered into an
    incompatible licensing or assignment agreement before the adoption
    of this policy"
- U Cal:
  - "...except for any articles published before the adoption of this
    policy"
  - "...except...any articles for which the Faculty member entered
    into an incompatible licensing or assignment agreement before the
    adoption of this policy."


### Waivers

- U Minn:
  - "will waive application of the license for a particular
    article...upon express direction by a faculty member."
  - "grant of such a waiver is mandatory, not at the the discretion of
    any person or group"
- U Kansas: "The license...will be waived by the Provost's Designate
  at the sole discretion of the faculty member upon written/electronic
  notification."
- U Cal: "Upon express direction by a Faculty member, the University
  of California will waive the license for a particular article"


### Access delay

- U Minn: "will delay access for a specified period of time...upon
  express direction by a faculty member" [as for waivers]
- U Cal: "Upon express direction by a Faculty member, the University
  of California will...delay access to the article for a specified
  period of time."


### Procedure

- U Minn \[[separately](http://www.policy.umn.edu/Policies/Research/SCHOLARLYARTICLES_PROC01.html)\]:
  - "Authors affected by the policy _may_ take action individually to
    make their work available to the public via the University Digital
    Conservancy or other non-profit open-access repositories."
  - "However, authors affected by the policy are not required to take
    individual action to make their works available in a non-profit
    open-access repository. They may alternatively take advantage of
    the active support services provided by the University Libraries."
  - "The University Libraries, at the direction of the Provost's
    Office, will provide active support services such as
    identification of eligible articles and communications with
    Faculty members about their options for achieving public access
    via the University of Minnesota Digital Conservancy or other
    non-profit open-access repositories. This process will include
    communication with authors, including multiple opportunities for
    authors to choose _not_ to share their works or to request an
    automatic waiver of the University's license."
- U Kansas: "faculty members will provide bibliographic information
  and an electronic copy of each article within 30 days of publication
  to the Provost's Designate."
- U Cal:
  - "Faculty commit to helping the University obtain copies of the
    articles."
  - "each Faculty member who does not
    permanently waive the license above will provide an electronic
    copy of his or her final version of the article to the University
    of California by the date of its publication, for inclusion in an
    open access repository."
  - "When appropriate, a Faculty member may
    instead notify the University of California if the article will be
    freely available in another repository or as an open-access
    publication."
  - "Faculty members who have permanently waived the
    license may nonetheless deposit a copy with the University of
    California or elsewhere for archival purposes."


### Periodic review of policy

- U Minn: "The policy will be reviewed after three years and a report
  presented to the faculty."
- U Kansas: "This policy will be reviewed by Faculty Governance, in
  concert with the Provost's office, every three years, and a report
  presented to Faculty Governance."
- U Cal: "The Academic Senate and the University of California will
  review the policy within three years, and present a report to the
  Faculty and the University of California."


### Oversight

- U Minn: "The Office of the Provost will be responsible for
  interpreting this policy, resolving any dispute concerning its
  interpretation and application, and recommending changes to the
  faculty from time to time."
- U Kansas: "A broadly representative Open Access Advisory Board made
  up of faculty, representatives from faculty governance, and the
  Provost's Office will provide additional guidance and oversight in
  policy implementation."
- U Cal: "The Academic Senate and the University of California will be
  jointly responsible for implementing this policy, resolving disputes
  concerning its interpretation and application, and recommending any
  changes to the Faculty."
