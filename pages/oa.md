title: Toward an Open Access Policy for UW-Madison
---

The
[University Library Committee](https://www.library.wisc.edu/about/university-library-committee/)
at the [University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison](http://www.wisc.edu)
has formed a working group to develop an Open Access Policy for
UW&ndash;Madison, through which university researchers would give
UW&ndash;Madison the right to freely distribute pre-prints of all
published journal articles.

[See the working group's instructions](../assets/OAWG_Charge_112014pdf.pdf)
from
[Edward Van Gemert](http://www.library.wisc.edu/about/directory/staff/Edward-Van-Gemert/),
Vice Provost for Libraries and University Librarian.


On 16 Nov 2015, the
[University Library Committee](https://www.library.wisc.edu/about/university-library-committee/)
adopted a [resolution](../assets/oa_resolution_v3.pdf) in favor of an
Open Access Policy for UW-Madison. [![pdf](icons16/pdf-icon.png)](../assets/oa_resolution_v3.pdf)
