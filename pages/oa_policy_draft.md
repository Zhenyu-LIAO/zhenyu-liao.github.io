title: "Draft Open Access Policy"
---

The
[University Library Committee](https://www.library.wisc.edu/about/university-library-committee/)
at the [University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison](http://www.wisc.edu)
has formed a working group to develop an Open Access Policy for
UW&ndash;Madison, through which university researchers would give
UW&ndash;Madison the right to freely distribute pre-prints of all
published journal articles.

The following is an initial draft of such a policy, based closely on the policy
at the University of
[Minnesota](http://www.policy.umn.edu/Policies/Research/SCHOLARLYARTICLES.html).

We have also drafted [an implementation plan](oa_implementation.html)
and a set of [anticipated questions (and our responses)](oa_questions.html).

Our intention is for this to provide a starting point for discussion,
with changes and suggestions both expected and welcomed.

### Draft Open Access Policy

In the spirit of the [Wisconsin Idea](https://wisconsinidea.wisc.edu/)
(the principle that "the university should improve people's lives
beyond the classroom"), researchers should seek to ensure the broad
accessibility of their scholarly articles, which are the primary
products of their research efforts. Towards this aim, and also
to simplify authors' retention of distribution rights and aid
preservation, the University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison has adopted
the following Open Access Policy.

Each faculty member grants to the University of
Wisconsin&ndash;Madison a shared, limited right to make available his
or her scholarly articles and corresponding
supplementary materials,
and to reproduce, display, and distribute
those articles for the purpose of open access. More specifically, each
faculty member grants the University of
Wisconsin&ndash;Madison a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free,
worldwide license to exercise such rights under copyright as are
necessary to achieve the goals of open access, dissemination, and
preservation, provided that the articles are not sold for profit, and
to authorize others to do the same.

The author retains copyright ownership, unless that author chooses to
transfer rights to other parties, such as a publisher. The University
retains only the limited rights outlined above.

The policy applies to all scholarly articles authored or co-authored
while the person is a faculty member at the University of
Wisconsin&ndash;Madison, except for any articles completed before the
adoption of this policy and any articles for which the author entered
into an incompatible licensing or assignment agreement before the
adoption of this policy.

The Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education or his/her designate will waive
application of the license for a particular article or delay access
for a specified period of time upon express direction by a faculty
member. Grant of such a waiver is mandatory and not at the discretion of
any person or group. Waiver requests must be made in writing, or via
an online form that will be made available for this specific purpose.

The Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education will be responsible for
interpreting this policy, resolving any dispute concerning its
interpretation and application, and recommending changes.
The policy will be reviewed after three years and a report presented
to the Faculty Senate.

The University Libraries will be responsible for implementing services
to support article processing and to communicate with authors about
deposition of particular works.

### Discussion

[SPARC](http://www.sparc.arl.org/) has a valuable
[document on "choice points" in forming an institutional OA policy](http://www.sparc.arl.org/sites/default/files/Choice%20Points_FINAL.pdf).
Below, we discuss each of these choices and how they relate to the
draft OA policy.


1. *Should your campus OA policy "request" or "require" deposit of
   faculty articles?*

   As written, the policy does not *require* faculty authors to
   provide the university with pre-prints of their journal
   articles. Such a requirement may be met with resistance from
   faculty, but would lead to more complete capture of faculty
   members' journal articles.

2. *To which types of content should your campus OA policy apply?*

   We're focusing solely on *journal articles*.

3. *Which types of content should your campus OA policy exclude?*

   We're not explicitly excluding any content.

4. *To whom should your campus open-access policy apply?*

   As written, the policy covers only university faculty. Journal
   articles by students and academic staff would be covered only if a
   faculty member were a co-author.

   Explicit inclusion of students and academic staff is worthy of
   consideration.

5. *What version of documents should your campus OA policy require
   authors to make available for deposit?*

   As written, the policy is not explicit on this point, but it might
   be modified to encourage or require that the final version of a
   peer-reviewed manuscript be deposited in the university
   repository.

6. *What should the timetable for deposit and accessibility be?*

   As written, there is no explicit time table, though there is
   mention of allowance of delayed access upon request.

7. *Should the campus OA policy allow faculty to opt-out?*

   The policy allows faculty authors to opt-out for specific
   articles.

8. *How should compliance with the campus OA policy be encouraged?*

   We anticipate development of a system that identifies relevant
   articles, with library staff then emailing faculty authors to
   request manuscripts.

9. *How will your campus OA policy secure the permissions necessary to
   provide Open Access?*

   The policy would preceed any copyright transfer agreements.
   Development of an author addenda to such agreements could help to
   ensure that publishers are aware of the university's OA policy.

10. *Will your campus OA policy remove permission barriers to reuse?*

    Through the policy, the university would be assigned all necessary
    rights for copying and distribution of the relevant articles.

11. *How will your institution establish and manage its institutional
    repository?*

    Articles will be made available through
    [Minds@UW](https://minds.wisconsin.edu/).

12. *Will your IR allow other types of content?*

    Content at [Minds@UW](https://minds.wisconsin.edu/) may include
    "research papers and reports, pre-prints and post-prints, datasets
    and other primary research materials, learning objects, theses,
    student projects, conference papers and presentations, and other
    born-digital or digitized research and instructional materials."
    (See [What is MINDS@UW](http://www.library.wisc.edu/digital-library-services/minds/).)

13. *Who should be responsible for developing and adopting a campus OA
    policy?*

    We believe that the official policy should ultimately come from
    the office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate
    Education, with the approval of the Faculty Senate.

14. *Will your campus OA policy require authors to publish in an OA
    journal?*

    The policy will not require authors to publish in an Open Access
    journal.

15. *How can your campus OA policy support journal sustainability?*

    The policy will allow waivers or delayed access, upon request.
